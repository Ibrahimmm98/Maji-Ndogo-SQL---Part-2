# Maji-Ndogo-SQL---Part-2
The second phase of my project focused on a comprehensive analysis of Maji Ndogo's water situation. I employed a sophisticated suite of SQL functions, including complex window functions, to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
This phase allowed me to demonstrate a strong command of SQL functions and window functions, as well as proficiency in data aggregation. I successfully applied these techniques to effectively clean and analyze the data, uncovering valuable patterns and trends within the water scenario.
